    "In the final stage, we'll conduct controlled experiments by modifying key architectural parameters to observe their effects on model performance and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Systematically vary attention mechanisms, layer configurations, and embedding dimensions\n",
    "- Measure performance impacts across multiple evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Analyze computational efficiency trade-offs\n",
    "- Create visualizations to illustrate parameter sensitivities\n",
    "- Document insights about transformer architecture design decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "While these experiments may often lead to performance degradation compared to the optimized GPT-2 parameters, they provide invaluable insights into the why behind architectural choicesâ€”transforming this project from an implementation exercise into a deep learning laboratory."

However, I can take logical conclusions from adjuting most of these values rather than directly seeing in on my model.\n"

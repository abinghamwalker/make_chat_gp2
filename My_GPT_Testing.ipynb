    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Systematically vary attention mechanisms, layer configurations, and embedding dimensions\n",
    "- Measure performance impacts across multiple evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Analyze computational efficiency trade-offs\n",
    "- Create visualizations to illustrate parameter sensitivities\n",
    "- Document insights about transformer architecture design decisions\n",

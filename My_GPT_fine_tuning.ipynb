    "## Stage 3: Fine Tuning the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Any foundational model is little more than a very highly skilled auto-complete, now comes the task of fine tuning.  This is where a foundational model is taught specifics about the job that it will eventaually do.  For the purposes of this exercise I am going to train a simple classifier using language inferrence to a job that you would assume would be through machine learning methods.  Secondly, I am going to make a simple agent model and also learn to score its accuracy using Ollama, it may be useful to refer to the first picture in My_GPT_construction as a guide to where I am.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- I need to download the fine tuning dataset and get it into dataloaders.\n",
    "- Load an LLM to process this information, then train all appropriate weights.\n",
    "- Evaluate and refine metrics to prove that the model is operating properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of this code will be more placeholder code, I will try to check that it works on one example or try and find a way to get it to run through collab.  This is more for a reminder of structure because the hardware demands appear to be quite intense to produce something noteworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a the example work flow which I will have to do twice for classification fine tuning and agent fine tuning."
